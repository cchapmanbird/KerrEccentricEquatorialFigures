We require initial semi-latus rectum of  10.001277735493163 for inspiral lasting 4.0 years
Your chosen semi-latus rectum is 10.628
Body is not plunging.
Final point in semilatus rectum achieved is 6.831963520273687
Separatrix :  1.2622111800099494
Separation between separatrix and final p =  5.569752340263738
Now going to load in class
